# Cyclistic Presentation

This repository contains a PDF presentation that summarizes a full data analysis case study for the Cyclistic bike-share company.

The analysis compares how **casual riders** (single-ride pass users) and **annual members** use Cyclistic bikes differently over one year of data (October 2020 to September 2021), and supports the marketing strategy to convert casual riders into members. [file:75]

## Key insights

- Casual riders ride about 2.5x longer than members on average. [file:75]  
- Saturday is the most popular day for all rider types, with members showing more stable weekday usage (commuting) than casual riders (tourism/weekend usage). [file:75]  
- Bike usage follows a clear seasonal pattern, peaking in summer and dropping in winter. [file:75]  
- Classic bikes are more popular than docked and electric bikes for both rider types. [file:75]

## Suggestions (from the analysis)

- Introduce a weekly membership to encourage frequent casual riders to become members. [file:75]  
- Offer discounts on long trips for members to attract long-trip casual riders. [file:75]  
- Provide weekday discounts (especially on Tuesdays) and intensify marketing for electric and docked bikes, with more campaigns in summer. [file:75]
